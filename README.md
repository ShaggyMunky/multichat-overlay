# Multichat Overlay

This is an interface with Streamer.bot that receives several different events and combines the notifications into a single chat window.

# Essentials

This project was Forked from `https://github.com/nuttylmao/multichat-overlay` and expanded to utilize TypeScript and make it a little more modular and scalable.

## Additional feature

- New feature added to apply the background to the individual message instead of remaining persistent on the entire container.

## Dev

Run `ng dev` to run the compiler. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Build and Production

Run `ng build` or `ng build:prod` to compile all of modules into a single file named `bundle.js` stored in the `build/` directory. `ng build:prod` minifies the file.

## Running scrits

The `index.html` references both files. Comment out the one not in use.
